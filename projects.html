              This image shows a Landsat satellite image of the Rice Lake, Ontario area in panchromatic greyscale
              from an older imaging system that did not have good geolocational coordination.
              If we want to extract useful data from an image like this, it needs to be geocorrected
              to fit with cooridate systems for referencing.  Using an overlay of projected and 
              georeferenced road networks (shown in red) we can see how much the original satellite image
              is "off" from the correct coordinates.  This road network was used to provide Ground Control
              Points by which the old satellite image could then be geocorrected to fit the road networkand
              its coordinate system.  Mouse Over the photo to see how the image looks after geoprocessing.

               This map illustrates the distribution of population density for St. Catharines, Ontario using
              2016 Census data. The data was extracted from Statistics Canada along with a shapefile for dissemination blocks
              which were then joined together in ArcGIS Pro. The dissemination blocks filed was clipped to the study area 
              and the population density was calculated and added as a new field. The data could then be displayed for each 
              dissemination block in the study area and displayed using visual hierarchy with the most dense areas darker than 
              less dense areas.

              This image shows a Site plan created using the software AUTOCAD and Coordinate Geometry
              that shows contours and topographic features. This site plan was created for a client near the Township of Ops
              to document the topographic features of the proposed area for construction. This site plan was created by looking at 
              a field report with information pertaining to the surveyed roads, lakes, and boathouse. Our job was to digitize
              these features and appropriately represent them so that construction could commence with the most accuracy.

                This map produced in order to study the crowded residential area and is used as a part of subsequential maps of the master Planning project for the municipality of Quebec city
