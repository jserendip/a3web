            <p> 
              This image shows a Landsat satellite image of the Rice Lake, Ontario area in panchromatic greyscale
              from an older imaging system that did not have good geolocational coordination.
              If we want to extract useful data from an image like this, it needs to be geocorrected
              to fit with coordinate systems for referencing.  Using an overlay of projected and 
              georeferenced road networks (shown in red) we can see how much the original satellite image
              is "off" from the correct coordinates.  This road network was used to provide Ground Control
              Points by which the old satellite image could then be geocorrected to fit the road network and
              its coordinate system.  <strong>Mouse Over</strong> the photo to see how the image looks after geoprocessing.

               This map illustrates the distribution of population density for St. Catharines, Ontario using
              2016 Census data. The data was extracted from Statistics Canada along with a shapefile for dissemination blocks
              which were then joined together in ArcGIS Pro. The dissemination blocks file was clipped to the study area 
              and the population density was calculated and added as a new field. The data could then be displayed for each 
              dissemination block in the study area and displayed using visual hierarchy with the most dense areas darker than 
              less dense areas.

              This image shows a Site plan created using the software AUTOCAD and Coordinate Geometry
              that shows contours and topographic features. This site plan was created for a client near the Township of Ops
              to document the topographic features of the proposed area for construction. This site plan was created by looking at 
              a field report with information pertaining to the surveyed roads, lakes, and boathouse. Our job was to digitize
              these features and appropriately represent them so that construction could commence with the most accuracy.

              <p>
                This image shows a Land Use map that covers Quebec City and its surrounding. This map used the UTM projection NAD 83 Zone 19.
                The map was produced in order to study the crowded residential area and is used as a part of subsequent maps of the Master Planning project for the municipality of Quebec city.

              <p>
                Though we now have access to a wealth of data, sometimes analysis can be hindered by having TOO 
                MUCH information.  When analysis depends upon cartographic visualization, it is important to be
                able to thin that information down appropriately to the working scale.  This image is a larger
                scale version of the previous Land Use map, but at this larger scale the road networks and other
                features have been appropriately generalized to convey the focus without the reader having to sort 
                through too much clutter on the map.

              <p>
                Many GIS processes involve the repeated use of sequences of geoprocessing tools.  Here we see 
                the application of a Model Building structure (in ESRI's ArcGIS Pro software) to visually construct
                reusable tools for commonly used workflows.  This is a tool sequence for analyzing raster data for
                site suitability (in this case to establish optimal territory for snail habitats based on elevation,
                geology and vegetation).  Combining Model Builder technology with programming in Python using arcpy
                we are able to systematize, and to some degree automate, many common GIS function, and so increase 
                efficiency.
