              This image shows a Landsat satellite image of the Rice Lake, Ontario area in panchromatic greyscale
              from an older imaging system that did not have good geolocational coordination.
              If we want to extract useful data from an image like this, it needs to be geocorrected
              to fit with cooridate systems for referencing.  Using an overlay of projected and 
              georeferenced road networks (shown in red) we can see how much the original satellite image
              is "off" from the correct coordinates.  This road network was used to provide Ground Control
              Points by which the old satellite image could then be geocorrected to fit the road networkand
              its coordinate system.  Mouse Over the photo to see how the image looks after geoprocessing.
